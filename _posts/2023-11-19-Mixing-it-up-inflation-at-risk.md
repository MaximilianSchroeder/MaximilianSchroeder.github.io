# Abstract
Measuring and monitoring macroeconomic uncertainty has become a key concern
of contemporary monetary policy and an active field of academic research. In this
paper, a joint approach is proposed that allows to construct risk measures that
capture the unknown and non-standard distribution of inflation in a way that consistent 
with central bank preferences. In addition, two algorithms are proposed that enable to monitor how economic predictors affect the risk outlook and how they shift probability mass across the forecast distribution. Both are widely applicable, enhance the interpretability of a broad
class of models, and are suitable for real-time applications. In the empirical exercises, the model yields superior
point and density forecasts of U.S. CPI inflation. During the recent
high-inflation period, inflation risk predominantly increased due to a
recovery of the U.S. business cycle and rising commodity prices and was in part
balanced by monetary policy and credit spreads.
