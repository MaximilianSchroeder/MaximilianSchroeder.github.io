# Abstract
We propose a multicountry quantile factor augmeneted vector autoregression
(QFAVAR) to model heterogeneities both across countries and across
characteristics of the distributions of macroeconomic time series. The presence of
quantile factors allows for summarizing these two heterogeneities in a
parsimonious way. We develop two algorithms for posterior inference that feature
varying level of trade-off between estimation precision and computational speed.
Using monthly data for the euro area, we establish the good empirical properties
of the QFAVAR as a tool for assessing the effects of global shocks on country-level
macroeconomic risks. In particular, QFAVAR short-run tail forecasts are more
accurate compared to a FAVAR with symmetric Gaussian errors, as well as
univariate quantile autoregressions that ignore comovements among quantiles of
macroeconomic variables. We also illustrate how quantile impulse response
functions and quantile connectedness measures, resulting from the new model, can
be used to implement joint risk scenario analysis.
