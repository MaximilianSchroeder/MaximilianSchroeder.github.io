# Abstract
Financial asset prices contain a rich set of real-time information on the economy. To extract this  information,  it  is  crucial to understand the  driving  factors  behindfinancial  marketdevelopments. In this paper, weexploit daily cross-asset price movements in a sign-restricted BVAR model to analyse the extent to which euro area and US yields, equity prices,and the euro-US dollar exchange rate are jointly driven by monetary policy, macroand global risk factors. A novelty is that we allow for cross-Atlantic spillovers while also accountingfor the unique role of the US in the global financial system. Our results underline the importance of US spillovers and shifts in global risk sentiment for understanding the dynamics of euro area financial variables. Euro area shocks transmit much less to US financial markets in comparison, with global risk shocks being more important instead. Using the daily shocks as instruments in a Proxy-SVAR, we demonstrate that the transmissionof financial market movementsto the macroeconomydepends on the underlying driver, thereby illustrating why it matters to look intothe driving factorsin the first place.
