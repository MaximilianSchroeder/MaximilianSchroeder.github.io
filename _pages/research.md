Macroeconomic indicators are expensive and complicated to compile and thus only available every quarter or month. Policy makers such as central banks, however, need to assess the status of the economy at a higher frequency than these indicators allow. Mixed-frequency techniques will thus continue to play an important role even in the age of big-data. Moreover, the increasing number of predictor variables that forecasters would like to incorporate to portrait reality as accurately as possible, quickly leads to parameter proliferation. By combining econometrics with the novel approaches that are proposed by machine learning, engineering, and computer science, I hope to contribute to a growing literature that develops techniques for estimating large-scale mixed-frequency models that are computationally efficient, reliable, and simple to use and maintain.
