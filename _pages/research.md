During my PhD, my research has concentrated on developing methods for monitoring and estimating macroeconomic risk. This field focuses on understanding the effects of economy wide shocks on the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.  Given the prevalence of unusually large fluctuations in economic aggregates in the recent past and the challenging policy environment that it creates, this literature has gained significant momentum in academic research as well as policy making institutions. Important examples include the Federal Reserve Bank and European Central Bank.
